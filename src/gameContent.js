I guess thanks to all those wars no one has time to get rid of them before they get that big. I found the boar in a nearby clearing and then you in here. I am a bit weary of strangers during this troubled times, but I couldn't leave you by yourself. I patched you up and stayed by your side until I saw you would recover and got back to my inn. I took the boar in payment. Anyway, if you find some other boar that you can handle, feel free to take care of them and soon enough you'll have enough coin to turn this cave into something a bit more pleasant.",
