With all those wars, I guess no one has time to get rid of the bloody things before they get that big. Oh well. I found the boar lying dead in a nearby clearing and you in this cave. I can't be bothered with strangers these days, but I couldn't decently leave you in such a mess. I patched you up, stayed by your side until you recovered and got back to my inn. I took the boar in payment, if you don't mind. Anyway, if you find some more that you can handle, feel free to take care of them. You'll get enough coins to turn this cave into something decent in no time!",
